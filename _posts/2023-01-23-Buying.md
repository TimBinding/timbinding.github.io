## Buying suggestions
Environmental considerations:
What material is the packaging and the product is made of?
How the packaging and the product is made?
How the packaging and the product will be recycled or composted at end of life?
How the packaging and the product is transported?

Find eco friendly alternative items:
Bamboo, charcoal, sugar cane, cloth or recycled material. For example if you need to buy something see if theirs a bamboo alternative e.g. (Bamboo / sugar cane / recycled) (paper / tissue paper / toilet paper). Bamboo toothbrushes.

Circular Economy:
If you need to buy anything: Buy used products e.g. ebay, amazon warehouse, gumtree, car boot, charity shops and your acquaintances.

Complete your house:
What is a house completed? You don't need to add anything new. Preferably biodegradable but having something that you need for longer is good too. (Zero waste stores are recommended)

No packaging when buying instore:
Bulk buy items from store without using any store packaging instead bring your own.

Reduce attachment to materialism:
Having a religious / spiritual experience has been proven to reduce attachment and get rid of addictions.
