## Car
Electric can be generated without using renewable energy and biofuels are renewable.
Hybrid - Uses electric and can switch to petrol or diesel (biofuel in the future).
Electric - All electric cars just use electric to power themselves. Deliberately limited range due to batteries.

List of renewable fuel types:
Electric
Biofuels
Hydrogen
Electrofuel

Considerations:
Remember not everyone will be able to get this technology like electric cars.
You can also use bikes or electric scooters.
Consider the problems with lithium batteries.
Take the bus / train instead of using the car.
If it is possible to walk, then walk.
Aim to make sure your daily commute to work does not use a car at all.
