#### Summary Technological Recommendations
##### Electric
- Solar panels or solar tile roofing
- Home Wind Turbines - Ridgeblade turbines
- Electric Travel - Electric / hybrid car or electric bike / scooter
- Electric Cooking - Ceramic hob, induction hob or hotplates (single hobs are available)
- Electric Heating - Get electric heating such as electric radiators
- Electric Water Heating - Solar Thermal Panels, electric water heaters, electric shower or electric boilers instead of gas
- Switch light bulbs to energy effient alternatives e.g. LED light bulbs

##### Water
- Water Harvesting System - Water harvesting system with effective filteration for house water
- AWG - Atomospheric Water Geneartion, collects water from huidity of the air usually used outside the house
- Gutter Water Collection - Gutter water collection (for garden)
- Bidet Toilet Sprayer - Can be handheld or built in (saves water, toliet paper)
- Sink On Top of toliet to recycle water (Sink Twice, Sink Again)
- Aerator Faucet - Either Soft Bubble Stream or Mist (recommended that you reduce pressure coming through the tap if possible)
- Low flow shower heads
- Toliets - Water efficient toliets with tap water recycling into toliet cistern or alternatively compost toliets

#### Reducing Usage
##### Minimizing Usage
- Use less electric - Switch off at the wall anything that you aren't using, electric timers can be used to 
- Use less water - recycle water when possible
- Buy less, waste less, reuse more
- Use transport less - Don't use cars
- Be as off grid and self reliant as you can
- Grow your own food and get chickens that can lay thier own eggs

##### Sacrifices
- Your luxury is GUARANTEED to be taken away so strip away what you don't need and live in subsistence.
- The key is to make sacrifices:
    - Give up going on vacations and holidays (long drives and airplanes)
    - Give up crisps and chocolate (the wrappers are not recyclable (terracycle is an option))
    - Give up petrol / diesel car (if possible switch to walking and bicycling but if you must have a car go atleast hybrid or electric)
    - Give up buying things online
    - Give up buying cheap things move to alternatives more costly green alternatives
    - Give up buying new clothes and buy used instead (knitting is also an option)
    - Give up electrical appliances and return to traditional ways of living (give up the boiler, the luxuries and go back to basics / subsistence) (get solar panels for the things you can't give up)
- If you can't give it up then use it less by spiritual experience and by focusing on eco living (without overly making decisions that have diminishing returns).

##### Waste methods
###### Low Trash Method
- Low Trash Goal - No black bin bags, recycle and compost everything and not buy things that don't achieve this goal.
- Recycling Sorting - Metal, Glass, Paper, Carboard, Food Waste, Garden Waste, Batteries, Textile and Soft Plastics.
- Use local composting if (thier are other ways to recycle food scraps)
- Alternatives - Use alternative materials that are sustainable e.g. bamboo, sugarcane, recycled, etc..

###### Zero Waste Method
- Zero Waste Goal - Make as little waste as possible including kerside recycling and food waste, adopt a personalized zero waste lifestyle.
- Home composting methods - EMO composting (Bokashi), Vermi composting (Worm Farm), Lomi (kitchen appliance composting) and Hotbin (Hot Composting).
- Reusable everything - Reusable Handkerchief, reusable kitchen cloth, cotton reusable bags, reusable beeswax food wraps, reusable silicon baking tray, reusable straws.
