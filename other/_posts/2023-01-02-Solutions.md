#### Three Types of Solutions
When coming up with a solution to a problem it is always a good idea to classify in one or more ways
- Bruteforce solution - Not optimal or even an ideal solution but at least it is a solution.
- Heuristic solution - Which means good enough, not quite optimal but it does the job.
- Optimal solution - The most efficient and effective solution.

#### Dialectical Method
When finding truth, the dialectical method is used.
One of the most common forms of dialectic is Hegelianism:
- Thesis is the initial idea presented.
- Anti-thesis is the challenge or contradiction to the thesis.
- Synthesis is the resolution or combination of the thesis and antithesis.

#### When thinking about finding a better solution to solve a resource usage problem, I recommend splitting between:
- Primitive solution / culture solution / celtic solution
- Technological solution / civilization solution / roman solution

### Technologcial Solutions
#### Examples of Technological solutions
- Solar panel system and installation
- Water harvesting or Atmospheric water generator
- Electrification of gas stoves and gas boilers

### Primitive Solutions
#### Examples of Primitive solutions
- Not using electrical appliances.
- Drinking from the fresh water spring.
- Cooking with wood fire.
