#### General Advice:
- Be careful with burning yourself out as a result of constant decision making.
- Don't oppress yourself for every little action and try to be as efficient as possible instead plan out the changes at first then change the small habits with focus at your own pace making sure that you focus on the bigger changes.
- Don't get yourself too nutrientantly deficient as this can lead into burnout (black bags under eyes, mental fog, fatigue, strange headaches), its worse if you aren't able to make changes due to mental problems.
- Do NOT get to overwhelmed by the thinking about the minor details (always bring it back to the bigger picture).
- Do NOT get too fixated on one area such as zero waste also remember to do electric, water, minimalism, etc...

#### Make Sacrifices
- Give up going on vacations and holidays (long drives and airplanes)
- Give up crisps and chocolate (the wrappers are not recyclable (terracycle is an option))
- Give up petrol / diesel car (if possible switch to walking and bicycling but if you must have a car go atleast hybrid or electric)
- Give up buying things online
- Give up buying cheap things move to alternatives more costly green alternatives
- Give up buying new clothes and buy used instead (knitting is also an option)
- Give up electrical appliances and return to traditional ways of living (get solar panels for the things you can't give up)

- If you can't give it up use it less by having a very indepth focus on the enviroment
