#### Minimizing Electric Usage
- Remember to turn off the lights when not in use.
- Replace lightbulbs with LED lightbulbs (0.5 - 3 Wattage light bulbs are available)
- Turn down the boiler flow temperature settings (hot water as low as it can go (40 degrees atleast) and radiator 50 degrees or lower)
- Turn down the freezer temperature
- Digital Electric timers - Turn off wifi, TV and devices that use energy at certain times particularly at night and if possible in the day when your out.
- Purchase Tumble dryer ball's to reduce drying time. (Alternatively don't use a dryer as its better to just dry naturally outside)

#### Minimizing Water Usage
- Replace ineffient water aerators faucets with Mist (for washing hands / food) or Soft Bubble Stream.
- Remember to turn off the water taps when not in use.
- Fix leaks - Leaks waste gallons of water over time so make sure that you find a way to fix them.
- Only boil the kettle with as much water as you need, this will prevent the kettle from boiling more than it needs.
- Reuse washing up water (grey water) for something like the garden.

#### Minimizing Heating Usage
- Loft insulation
- Cavity wall insulation
- Seal all drafts
- More people together in a room including pets
- Micro climate / warm room - Setup a tent, carpet
- Use sleeping bags with quilts
- Wear layers (thermals, coats)

#### Minimizing Other Usage
- Cut soaps into small squares and place them in boxes so that they can be separated and used when needed. This prevents the water from destroying them quickly when in use.
- Washing line rain cover so that you can use a washing line even if its going to rain.
- Wait for a full load of washing before putting it in.
- Don't throw away things that can be recycled or make something unrecyclable, I understand that newspaper makes for great painting or padding for pets but newspaper is very easily recycled and by not having it go into the recycling cycle properly we lose the oppertunity to have it come back on someones.
