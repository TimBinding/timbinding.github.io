#### Minimizing Electric Usage
- Remember to turn off the lights and electrical devices when not in use.
- Replace lightbulbs with LED lightbulbs (0.5 - 3 Wattage light bulbs are available)
- Digital Electric timers - Turn off wifi, TV and devices that use energy at certain times particularly at night and if possible in the day when your out.
- Purchase Tumble dryer ball's to reduce drying time. (Alternatively don't use a dryer as its better to just dry naturally outside)
- Turn Computer monitor refresh rate down by typing in "view advanced display info".
- Use power-saving features: Activate power-saving features on your electronics, such as sleep mode on computers, to reduce energy consumption when not in use e.g. Turn on battery saving mode on laptops, >10 minutes till sleep.
- Use memory savers and battery savers on browsers if applicable otherwise turn off hardware acceleration on the browser settings.
- Don't use 'eco' settings, go as low as you can. Find online the manual for the appliance using the code. Try lower settings on an unimportant batch to see if it is better.
- Smart power strips - Use smart power strips that automatically cut off power to devices that are not in use. This can help eliminate phantom power consumption.
- Energy-efficient appliances - When purchasing new appliances, look for energy-efficient models that bear the ENERGY STAR label.
- Turn down the freezer temperature
- Use natural ventilation - On mild days, open windows and use fans to circulate fresh air instead of relying on air conditioning.
- Energy-efficient window coverings - Install blinds, shades, or curtains that are designed to regulate temperature. They can help keep your home cooler in summer and warmer in winter, reducing the need for excessive heating or cooling.
- Use a laptop instead of a desktop computer - Laptops generally consume less energy than desktop computers, so consider using a laptop if it meets your needs.
- Energy-efficient landscaping - Planting trees strategically around your home can provide shade in the summer, reducing the need for air conditioning, and act as windbreaks in the winter, reducing heating needs.
- Monitor your energy usage - Invest in an energy monitor that displays real-time energy usage. This can help you identify which appliances are using the most energy and adjust your behavior accordingly.
- Conduct an energy audit - Consider hiring a professional or doing a DIY energy audit of your home. This can help identify areas where energy is being wasted and provide recommendations for improvements.
- Practice energy-conscious gaming: Adjust the graphics settings of your video games to lower resolution and frame rates, reducing the energy consumption of your gaming system.
- Utilize power-saving modes on gaming consoles: Most gaming consoles have power-saving modes that can significantly reduce energy usage during times of inactivity.
- Embrace manual alternatives - Instead of using electric appliances for tasks like grinding coffee beans or whisking ingredients, try manual alternatives like a hand grinder or a whisk. Manual can opener, manual push mower,
- Use a solar-powered charger - Invest in a solar-powered charger for your mobile devices. It charges your devices using sunlight, reducing the need for electricity.
- Explore kinetic energy options - Look for devices that utilize kinetic energy, like self-powered flashlights or wireless charging pads that generate energy from motion. These can be an interesting and eco-friendly alternative.
- Utilize reflective window film - Apply reflective window film to your windows to reduce heat gain during hot summer months. This helps keep your home cooler without relying too much on air conditioning.
- Try a solar cooker - Explore solar cooking options, such as a solar oven or solar-powered stove. These utilize sunlight to cook food, helping to reduce electricity or gas usage in the kitchen.

#### Minimizing Water Usage
- Replace ineffient water aerators faucets with Mist (for washing hands / food) or Soft Bubble Stream.
- Remember to turn off the water taps when not in use.
- Fix leaks - Leaks waste gallons of water over time so make sure that you find a way to fix them.
- Only boil the kettle with as much water as you need, this will prevent the kettle from boiling more than it needs. (pro tip: Use a cup and fill with water to the amount that you intend to use)
- Reuse washing up water (greywater) for something like the garden.
- When running the tap for impurtities use a jug to capture the water your not using then use it like greywater.
- The biggest use of the water will be the toliet "if its yellow let it be mellow, if its brown flush it down". Put aside your disgust sensitivity.
- Wait for a full load of washing before putting it in.
- Shorter showers

#### Minimizing Heating Usage
- Combi-boiler - Turn down the boiler flow temperature settings (hot water as low as it can go (40 degrees atleast) and radiator 50 degrees or lower) (legionnaire disease)
- Loft insulation
- Cavity wall insulation
- Seal all drafts
- More people together in a room including pets
- Micro climate / warm room - Setup a tent, carpet
- Use sleeping bags with quilts
- Wear layers (thermals, coats)

#### Minimizing Other Usage
- Cut soaps into small squares and place them in boxes so that they can be separated and used when needed. This prevents the water from destroying them quickly when in use.
- Washing line rain cover so that you can use a washing line even if its going to rain.
- Don't throw away things that can be recycled or make something unrecyclable, I understand that newspaper makes for great painting or padding for pets but newspaper is very easily recycled and by not having it go into the recycling cycle properly we lose the oppertunity to have it come back on someones.
- Switch over to paperless.
- Switch your search engine to "Ecosia.org" and occasionally click one of the ads, ecosia plants trees with the ad money it makes (click on the link of the ads to help it make money)
